- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Engulf5171
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in QA automation, be that small tests that ping one end point, to huge UI based tests with many assertions. I like making sure things keep working, and they stay that way. Finding out the best way to do that is something I don't think I'll ever be able to answer, but I wouldn't mind trying.
